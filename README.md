# PuzzleWebsite
 A small website aiming to create simple puzzles from a folder of images
 Currently it is capable of loading and resizing an image and dividing it into sections.
 The user can click on 2 tiles to swap then

# TODO
 Averaging colours and stuffs for QOL
 A multi select or lock group or smth for easier multi-tile manipulation
 Improve css and html element position
    So you know, you can zoom in and stuff
 Also, fix the annoying thing with the boxes. Already know the cause, but can't think of a solution
