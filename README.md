# PuzzleWebsite
 A small website aiming to create simple puzzles from a folder of images
 Currently it is capable of loading and resizing an image and dividing it into sections.
 The user can click on 2 tiles to swap then

# TODO
 Shuffle function, to, you know... actually shuffle the puzzle pieces
 Make the swap function into a drag and drop version
    (Maybe make a toggleable switch??)
 A checkbox for locking and unlocking tile amount
   (The hardest part is finding a good position)
